I am a Ph.D. candidate with [Prof. Xiaodan Fan](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xfan/) in the Department of Statistics at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) (since 2020). My research interest is in Bayesian statistics, Bayesian nonparametric statistics, multi-omics integration, and statistics computing. I focus on developing novel statistical models to solve biological problems, including clustering single-cell RNAseq data and spatial transcriptomics data. 

Before that, I received M.S. degree (2019) with [Prof. Ning Jiao](http://dmc.sps.bjmu.edu.cn/gbenglish/faculty/researchsu/221415.htm) in Medicine Chemistry and B.S. degree (2017) in Pharmaceutical Science from the School of Pharmaceutical Science at Peking University.
